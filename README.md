## Tech Stack

The technology stack and architecture employed in the development of this multivendor food app are as follows:

* ### Front-End:

  For the Front-End, Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, was utilized as the primary framework. Vue.js was coupled with HTML for structuring the web pages and Tailwind CSS for styling and design.

* ### Back-End:

  The Back-End infrastructure relied on the Flask Python framework to construct a robust and scalable Restful API. Initially, during the development phase, Mysql was chosen as the primary database management system. However, for production-ready deployment, the database transitioned to Postgres due to its enhanced capabilities and performance benefits.

* ### Hosting and Deployment:

  The app's Back-End services were hosted on Heroku, a cloud platform that facilitated seamless deployment and ensured reliable hosting for the application.

This tech stack and architecture amalgamated the strengths of Vue.js for the dynamic and responsive Front-End, Flask for constructing a powerful Back-End API, and the optimal database management system transition from Mysql to Postgres to meet production-grade demands. Hosting on Heroku contributed to the app's scalability and stability during deployment.
